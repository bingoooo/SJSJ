# CouchDB

[Apache CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/), commonly referred to as CouchDB, is an open source database that focuses on ease of use and on being "a database that completely embraces the web".

It is a document-oriented NoSQL database that uses [JSON](JSON.md) to store data, JavaScript as its query language using MapReduce, and HTTP for an API.

CouchDB was first released in 2005 and later became an Apache project in 2008.
