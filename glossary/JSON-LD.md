# JSON-LD 

[JSON-LD (JSON for Linked Data)](http://json-ld.org/) is a lightweight Linked Data format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is based on the already successful JSON format and provides a way to help [JSON](JSON.md) data interoperate at Web-scale. JSON-LD is an ideal data format for programming environments, REST Web services, and unstructured databases such as [CouchDB](COUCHDB.md) and [MongoDB](MONGODB.md).
