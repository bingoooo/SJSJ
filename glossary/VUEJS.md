# VueJS

[VueJS](http://vuejs.org/) is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces (views) based on underlying datamodels. Instead of only updating userdata in the DOM, a datamodel will be in sync to reflect the changes. Vue works through reactive data-binding. It means when you update for example a form-field, the underlying datamodel is updated automatically. When other parts of the website are also bound to the same datamodel, it's content will update immediately.
